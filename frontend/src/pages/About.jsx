      <p>
        Hi, I'm <strong> Shaswat Gautam</strong>, a passionate Full-Stack Web
        Developer specializing in the
        <strong> MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).</strong>
        With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern tools like
        Tailwind CSS and jQuery, I build responsive, dynamic, and user-friendly
        web applications from the ground up. From creating seamless front-end
        interfaces to developing robust back-end APIs, I enjoy crafting complete
        web solutions that solve real-world problems. I'm always eager to learn,
        experiment, and grow with the latest trends in web development.
      </p>
      <h2 className="font-semibold text-blue-800 text-xl">More</h2>
      <p>
        I started my journey in web development out of curiosity, which quickly
        grew into a deep passion for creating intuitive and efficient digital
        experiences. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and
        continuously improving both the user interface and the functionality
        behind it. On the front-end, I bring designs to life using HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, React, Tailwind CSS, and jQueryâ€”crafting responsive layouts
        that feel smooth across all devices. On the back-end, I focus on
        building secure and optimized APIs using Express and Node.js, with
        MongoDB as my go-to database for flexible, document-oriented data
        handling. But more than just knowing technologies, I understand how to
        connect ideas, users, and functionality into real-world solutions. Iâ€™m
        constantly pushing myself to learn moreâ€”whether itâ€™s improving
        performance, diving into deployment, or understanding user behavior. I
        take pride in being someone who: Thinks like a user, codes like an
        engineer Loves debugging as much as building Enjoys collaborating, but
        also works independently with focus Believes that consistency perfection
        Currently, I'm exploring opportunities to contribute to real-world
        projects, collaborate with like-minded developers, and grow further as a
        full-stack engineer.
      </p>
      <h2 className="font-semibold text-blue-800 text-xl">ðŸŽ¯ The Mission</h2>
      <p>Iâ€™m currently seeking opportunities to work on exciting real-world projects, collaborate with other creators, and level up my skills while delivering value.

If youâ€™re looking for someone who codes with passion, thinks in systems, and learns like a spongeâ€”letâ€™s connect.</p>
